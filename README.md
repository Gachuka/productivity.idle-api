# Lessons Learned
Most calculation should be done on the server side so that the server remains the single source of truth. 

Having everything as a formula and not just functions makes calculations faster and less of a hassle to read.

# Next Steps

Improve cost per upgrade formula so the game does not feel to drag on at times.

Adding math formula to implement a prestige system to progress even further at a faster pace.
